1. ESP-NOW (Direct Device-to-Device, Recommended for ESP32)
ESP-NOW is a low-latency, low-power wireless protocol built into ESPHome for ESP32 devices, enabling peer-to-peer communication without Wi-Fi infrastructure or a broker. Using the packet_transport: espnow platform, you can directly reference a remote sensor's value as if it were local.

Requirements: ESP32 on all devices; configure MAC addresses as peers; optional shared encryption key for security. Devices must be in range (~100m line-of-sight).
Setup:
On the provider device (sensor source):

espnow:
  peers:
    - "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"  # Consumer's MAC address

packet_transport:
  platform: espnow
  peer_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"  # Or broadcast: "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"
  encryption:
    key: "YourSecretKey123"  # Optional
  providers:
    name: my-provider  # Unique provider name
  sensors:
    remote_temp:  # Local sensor being shared
      sensor:
        platform: bme280  # Example sensor
        id: remote_temp
        name: "Remote Temp"

# On the consumer device (references the remote sensor):

espnow:
  peers:
    - "11:22:33:44:55:66"  # Provider's MAC address

packet_transport:
  platform: espnow
  encryption:
    key: "YourSecretKey123"  # Match provider
  providers:
    my-provider  # Matches provider's name
  sensors:
    my_temp_copy:
      platform: packet_transport
      provider: my-provider
      remote_id: remote_temp  # References the provider's sensor ID
      name: "Copied Remote Temp"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"

How it works: The provider shares the sensor automatically. The consumer treats my_temp_copy as a local sensor, with values synced in real-time/low-latency. Use in lambdas, automations, or displays on the consumer.
Limitations: ESP32-only; requires manual MAC config; broadcast mode increases traffic.
