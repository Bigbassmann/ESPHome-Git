# PMS7003 - 
# PMS7003 TX (SEND) → Xiao RX (GPIO20/D7/UART0_RX)
# PMS7003 RX (RECEIVE) → Xiao TX (GPIO21/D6/UART0_TX)  # Optional for passive mode, but include it
# PMS7003 VCC → 5V (if available) or 3.3V (check sensor specs; PMS7003 typically needs 5V)
# PMS7003 GND → GND

# No need to include board here—it's already in main

# PMSX003 sensor referencing the PMS UART
